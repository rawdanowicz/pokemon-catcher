My recruitment task for TechMinds sp. z o.o., built with **Angular CLI** (version 11.0.4).
App is accessible for screen-reader-only users. I have tested it with keyboard and NVDA and it gives a full experience also for people limited to these tools. It's responsive on all types of devices both portrait and landscape view. To avoid unnecessary redirects there's a custom **404** error page with home button. For even better user experience you can *install* it on your device thanks to **PWA** capabilities.

## Images

Pokeball graphics and player icon were made by [Nikita Golubev](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/nikita-golubev). Images that also contain text (like a logo) were edited by me using **Gimp** and **Pokémon Solid** font.
All of the images were tinified using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/).
